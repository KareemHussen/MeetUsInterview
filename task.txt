Goal 
This assignment will allow us to see how you approach API design, security, and code organization in Spring Boot.
Build a small REST API using Java Spring Boot that handles user authentication and a simple task management system.

This assignment is designed to evaluate your Spring Boot skills, code structure, and problem-solving level (junior, mid, or senior).

 Requirements
1. User Registration
Endpoint: POST /auth/register

Request body:

   

    {
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "mypassword",
  "name": "John Doe"
}

   
Store user with hashed password (e.g., BCrypt).

2. User Login
Endpoint: POST /auth/login

Request body:

   

    {
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "mypassword"
}

   
On success: return accessToken (JWT preferred).

On failure: return HTTP 400 with JSON error.

3. Task Management
Only accessible with valid token.

Endpoints:

POST /tasks → Create task {title, description, status}

GET /tasks → Fetch all tasks for logged-in user only

PUT /tasks/{id} → Update task status (e.g., open → done)

DELETE /tasks/{id} → Delete a task

4. Logout
Endpoint: POST /auth/logout

Invalidate token/session (in-memory or JWT expiration).

Exceptional Scenarios
Invalid email/password → 400 Bad Request

Accessing /tasks without token → 401 Unauthorized

Accessing another user’s task → 403 Forbidden

Non-Goals
No need for advanced JWT refresh logic.

No frontend/UI needed (test with Postman or curl).

No external DB required (H2 in-memory DB acceptable).

Evaluation Criteria
Must-Have
RESTful endpoints with correct HTTP status codes.

Spring Boot best practices (Controller, Service, Repository layers).

Authentication & security:

Token-based auth (JWT or session token).

Password hashing (BCrypt).

Error handling with @ControllerAdvice.

Organized project structure with clear packages.

Public GitHub/GitLab repository.

Nice-to-Have (For Senior Candidates)
JWT with expiration & refresh handling.

DTO & Entity separation with mapping.

Global exception handling with custom error responses.

Unit tests (JUnit) for at least one endpoint.

Clean commits, meaningful Git history.

Expected Time
2–4 hours.
